    - Fixed joke ID caching (to not serve the same jokes multiple times)
    - Added three new commands that are run through CI and before contributing
    - Enabled automated code fixing with ESLint


[2.0.0] - The complete rewrite - JokeAPI was completely rewritten and should now run like 100x better and be more easy to develop and maintain
    - Massively improved the "Try it out" section in the docs
    - Reformatted the jokes to always contain all flags
    - Added support for selecting multiple categories at once (for example: "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Dark,Miscellaneous/")
    - Massive performance improvements:
        - The documentation page and some static content are now able to be served with gzip, deflate and brotli encoding, decreasing the required bandwidth and speeding up page loading time
        - Reformatted the jokes to have the IDs beforehand, furthermore increasing performance and making it easier to know which joke ID belongs to which joke
        - Now the documentation page runs on a daemon, meaning it will only be recompiled if a file has changed, massively improving JokeAPIs perfomance
        - Static content like the stylesheet, client-side JS and images will now be loaded separately, through the "static" endpoint, decreasing page load time by an order of magnitude
    - Added a few new URL parameters:
        - Added the "?type" URL parameter to specify the type of the served joke ("single" or "twopart")
        - Added the "?contains" URL parameter to only serve jokes that match the provided search query
        - Added the "?idRange" URL parameter to get jokes from a single ID or an ID range (example: "https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any?id=50-75" or "...?id=15")
    - Added the "racist" and "sexist" flags for better filtering of offensive jokes
    - IP addresses are now hashed, protecting JokeAPI's users better and making it GDPR/DSGVO compliant
    - Added multiple scripts that should be run before contributing to the project / that are run through GitHub's Continuous Integration:
        - "npm run reformat" to reformat jokes from the old pre-2.0.0 syntax to the new 2.0.0 syntax
        - "npm run reassign-ids" to make sure all jokes have the correct IDs
        - "npm run validate-jokes" to make sure all jokes are in the correct format
        - "npm run add-joke" to add a joke
    - Renamed "category" endpoint to "joke"
    - The submission of empty jokes will now be prevented
    - Set up a new reverse proxy at "https://sv443.net/jokeapi/v2/" to let people slowly migrate to the new version
    - Re-validated all jokes and removed duplicates and re-flagged them
    - Added an analytics module that keeps track of everything and makes it possible for me to finally see some (anonymous) usage statistics (complies with the GDPR/DSGVO)
    - Joke IDs will now be cached to prevent the same joke from being served multiple times in a row (this is not perfect yet but much better than before)
    - The documentation page was completely rewritten and should now be easier to use and more concise
    - Updated dependencies and added some new ones
    - Updated the contributor guide (contributing.md file)
